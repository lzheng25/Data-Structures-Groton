/* Thought Questions
 * 
 * 1. To check if a species has completely eliminated the other, we loop through the creatures in the
 * ArrayList of creatures to check if their species are the same. If all are the same, then that species 
 * has won. So for our animation loop, instead of while(true), the loop will only run there is more than one
 * species on the grid. once we exit this loop, we add one win to the species. We can track wins using an
 * ArrayList and assign each index to one of the species. Now, to get an overall win percentage of one
 * species versus another, we need to run the animation loop many times for a large sample size. Let's say
 * 50 times for this example. To do this, we would just place the while loop inside a for loop that runs 50 times.
 * Finally, to calculate our win percentage for a species, get its number of wins from the ArrayList of wins
 * and divide it by the total number of rounds which is 50.
 * This all seems functional but it actually wouldn't guarantee an answer. In some scenarios, the animation
 * never ends. For example, in a battle between Rovers and Flytraps, we could end up with all the Flytraps
 * bunched up and stationary in the middle while a singular Rover is roaming around the edge of the world 
 * indefinitely. Here, it would be a never ending game of Darwin where no one species would come out as 
 * victorious, thus halting our program.
 * 
 * 2. Compiled languages run faster than interpreted languages since the source code is already precompiled, but
 * they run through errors in the code without stopping. Compiled languages can cause stack overflow/system crashes, 
 * and when those occur itâ€™s harder to locate the errors.
 * Interpreted languages stop at errors but they run slower since the source code is compiled in real time. 
 * JIT compilers are both compilers and interpreters. When a function is called, they compile it and then run 
 * the compiled machine-code. Since the program is running off machine-code, it will be faster than a regular compiler. 
 * Furthermore, if a certain function has errors, the JIT compiler knows where the errors are in that specific function 
 * since they occur after that function is compiled. Thus, JIT compilers have the advantages of both compiled 
 * and interpreted languages.
 * 
 * 3. I do agree that to go statement is too primitive, and, through creating some of my own creatures, I realized
 * how messy and confusing my code can get with them. I think on a basic level to go statement works great for
 * Darwin. At the end of the txt file, you simply use "go 1" to loop back to the start which is extremely concise.
 * Flytrap is an excellent example of using the go statement in an easy way. However, as we build more complex creatures,
 * the go statement can get out of hand - even the rover creature is slightly confusing, especially since it has numerous
 * go statements. When I am creating my own creature, the go statement is very annoying because I need to change the address
 * of go because I added a few lines here and there. Furthermore, complex creatures can lead to do overuse of go, making the code
 * hard to decipher. And if you forget a go statement or give it the wrong address, it can be very hard to debug. 
 * Overall, I think the go statement is great for basic programs, but more complicated programs will inevitably result in the
 * overuse of the go statement, leading to unstructured, even illegible code.

/**
* This class controls the simulation. The design is entirely up to
* you. You should include a main method that takes the array of
* species file names passed in and populates a world with species of 
* each type.
* <p>
* Be sure to call WorldMap.pause every time
* through the main simulation loop or else the simulation will be too fast
* and keyboard / mouse input will be slow. For example: 
* <pre>
*	public void simulate() {
*	for (int rounds = 0; rounds < numRounds; rounds++) {
*           giveEachCreatureOneTurn();
*           WorldMap.pause(100);
*         }
*	}
* </pre>
